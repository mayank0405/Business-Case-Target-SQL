## Problem Statement 

At Scaler, I was fortunate enough to work on a real business case project. This particular business case focuses on the operations of Target in Brazil and provides insightful information about 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018.

It would be insightful to know about...

- Trends in number of orders
- How customers are distributed accross regions
- How is the delivery service of Target 

## Datasets Used 

Unfortunately, since this is a confidential project, I cannot share the dataset of this project. I can only share the names of the csv files used in this project. They are as following:- 

- customers.csv
- sellers.csv
- order_items.csv
- geolocation.csv
- payments.csv
- reviews.csv
- orders.csv
- products.csv
